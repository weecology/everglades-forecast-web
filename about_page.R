         computational and statistical methods to understand ecological systems using large ecological
         and environmental datasets. We do cutting edge research, collect and publish large open datasets,
         develop open source software, build websites, train scientists in computational tools, and

      populations of eastern North Carolina. She joined UF initially in 2014 and assisted in research
      focused on native and exotic reptiles, amphibians, and crocodilians across the Greater Everglades
      Ecosystem. As research coordinator, Lindsey trains seasonal Wading Bird field crew members, manages
      the day-to-day field work, conducts impromptu airboat repair, and compiles annual reports. She holds
      a remote pilot certificate and conducts aerial surveys for the lab’s new and exciting UAV program."
